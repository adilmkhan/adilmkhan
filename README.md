# Hi, I’m Adil 👋

**Solutions Architect @ Missouri Department of Mental Health (Division of Developmental Disabilities)**  
Cloud-first builder focused on secure, compliant data systems in healthcare/public sector. I design and document **AWS- and Azure-backed** architectures, stand up **serverless/data pipelines**, and ship pragmatic solutions with clear tradeoffs and strong governance.

- 🔭 **Now:** leveling up full-stack foundations (HTML/CSS/JS → React, Node/Express, MongoDB) while sharpening cloud patterns & IaC.
- 🧩 **Interests:** cloud-native microservices, FHIR/security, data privacy, cost/perf optimization, documentation-as-a-feature.
- 🤝 **Open to:** collaborating on healthcare data workflows, infra modernization, and evidence-driven proofs of concept.
